# Arduino fan emulator

### 📌 Part list
✔ Arduino Nano ( or  any other based on 328p)  
✔ 1 * 10K resistor  
✔ 1 * 1K resistor  
✔ 1 * npn 2n222* transistor  
✔ wires, connectors  

Upload code to arduino via [Arduino IDE](https://www.arduino.cc/en/Main/Software)

### 📌 Arduino is powered from fan terminal directly
🔌 Black is GND  
🔌 Red is +12V  
🔌 Yellow wire - PG (usualy 3rd is fan output that we are going to emulate).

### 📌 Connection
1️⃣ You need to connect +12V to VIN pin of Arduino, and GND to GND pin.  
2️⃣ 2n222 collector should be connected to +12V (or +5v if there is no way to get 12v) through 10K resistor  
3️⃣ 2n222 base should be connected to D9 through 1K resistor  
4️⃣ 2n222 emitter should be connected to GND  
5️⃣ Output signal will be generated between 10R resistor and collector.
